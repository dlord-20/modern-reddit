A react redux reddit application that pulls data from reddits jsons api. The application allows you to search for subreddits, change categories, and even select the date range when possible. Application will load data by 10's up to 100 posts depending on your filtered selections.

The applications design is also responsive depending on screen size.

The application uses javascipt, html, jsx, and css. The simple app was made to test what I've been learning in my codecadamy path. 

The app also uses FontAwesome to add a couple of icons to make the application look a little nicer.

Additions to be made:
    - Dark Theme Toggle
    - Better dropdown design
