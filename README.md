A react redux reddit application that pulls data from reddits jsons api. 

The application uses javascipt, html, jsx, and css. The simple app was made to test what I've been learning in my codecadamy path. 

Honestly, I've been sick so I haven't had time to write a good readme but I made a goal to commit something everything every day so here we are.
